        <p>Located in the Ría de Arousa, in the province of Pontevedra, Cambados is a historic fishing village carved in granite, declared a Historic-Artistic Site in 2001.

Its pazos, its stately homes and one of the most beautiful cemeteries in Galicia, in addition to its coveted seafood and good Albariño wine, have made Cambados one of the most admired and interesting tourist destinations in Galicia.

Capital of Albariño wine and headquarters of the Fiesta del Albariño, of International Tourist Interest, this noble town is much more than wineries and seafood platters, since there are many tourist attractions in its surroundings.
